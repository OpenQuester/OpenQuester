# E2E Test Lifecycle Rules

- Use `ServerTestHarness` for new E2E suites that need a running server.
- Exercise the real HTTP and Socket.IO transports through `serverUrl`.
- All async waits must be named and bounded.
- Timeout failures must include the operation or event, timeout duration, and actor/socket context.
- Close Socket.IO clients before stopping the harness.
- Cleanup failures must fail the test run; do not catch and only log them.
- Do not use direct sleeps for readiness, event delivery, or cleanup.
- Do not copy lifecycle setup or teardown code into individual suites.
- Do not add production hot-path instrumentation solely to support tests.
- Use port `0` for new isolated lifecycle tests unless a fixed-port failure path is under test.
- The event journal/scenario DSL belongs to a later phase.
- Do not migrate existing game tests in this phase.
